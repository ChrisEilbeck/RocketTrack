# RocketTrack
Overarching rocket tracking project using LoRa, primarily on ESP32 board but
you never know ...

This project is split into two parts, the beacon part which flies on the
rocket and the receiver part which is typically mounted on a directional
antenna used as part of the rocket recovery process.
